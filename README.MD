### Additional Information

[^1]: It's possible certain errors will appear due to certificates not being able to be generated. In which case, I recommend using manual solutions to create a certificate.

[^2]: If the browser doesn't open up by itself, you can copy and go to the localhost URL.

[^3]: Decided for in-line CSS for styling components instead of CSS modules due to better compatibility.
